# Little Shop | Group Project | Frontend Starter Repo

This Little Shop FE Group Project Boilerplate is built to consume and display the data from the BE Rails API built in the Mod 2 Group Project.  

Your group will pull down and continue building out your own version of this front end application.

## Set Up Instructions

**Note:** Do **not** clone this repo into your backend repo. Put it somewhere else as a stand alone. The BE and FE repos will remain two separate repos and you will submit the links to each.  

1. Fork repo
1. Clone forked repo and rename it `git clone <repo> <new name>` (Do not clone this into your BE repo. See note above.)
1. `cd` into cloned repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start developing.
  1. You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"


## Notes

This FE application is build to consume the data from your Rails API.  In order for it to work, you must have your Rails API running on localhost:3000. You will see fetch errors when running the FE without the BE API up and running.  

Follow the directions in the FE requirements portion of the Little Shop group project spec. When you are finished with the FE work, update this README to remove the current content and follow the template below.  



# Little Silk Road 

### Abstract:
(Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Installation Instructions:
(What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Fork and Clone from theses repos: [Silk Road FE](https://github.com/jchirch/little-silkroad-fe) [Silk Road BE](https://github.com/stefanjbloom/little_silk_road)

### Preview of App:
(Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
This proiject was completed over the course of and 8 day sprint by a team of Turing students.

### Learning Goals:
- Use ActiveRecord and SQL to write queries that deal with one-to-many database relationships
- Expose API endpoints to CRUD database resources
- Validate models and handle sad paths for invalid data input
- Test both happy and sad path functionality based on JSON contracts
- Use MVC to organize code effectively, lmiting data logic in controllers and serializers
- Track user stories with GitHub Projects
- Improve an existing FE application by:
- Styling the user interface
- Refactoring JavaScript code
- Adding an additional FE feature
- Reading Documentation
- Time Management
- Prioritizing Work
- Breaking down large project into small pieces
- Breaking down a problem into small steps
- Practice individual research (articles, videos, mentors)

### Wins + Challenges:
- A significant portion of the hurdles faced with this project was the practice of merging other's code into our branches and resolving merge conflicts. Its difficult to look at code one did not write, interpret what it does, and how to blend it into your own code.
